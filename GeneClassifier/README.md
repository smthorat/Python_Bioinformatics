# GeneClassifier
GeneClassifier is a Python tool that uses genomic annotations (GTF files) to classify gene and non-gene regions in DNA sequences stored in FASTA format. By leveraging the power of data structures like interval trees, this tool efficiently identifies which regions of a genome are associated with genes and which are not. It processes large sequences using batch tokenization, making it memory-efficient for handling extensive genomic datasets.

The tool is designed to be flexible and scalable, suitable for bioinformatics researchers or students working on genomic data analysis tasks. With a focus on efficiency, it can handle large genome datasets and classify regions in a clear, structured manner.
